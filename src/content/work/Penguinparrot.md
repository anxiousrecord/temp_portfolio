> Puzzle game

Penguin and parrot was a puzzle game I've designed. The gameplay revolves around controlling the penguin and the parrot moves in the opposite direction of wherever you move. So if i move up then parrot moves down. This allowed for some interesting mechanics and puzzle however I had to cut the game short and I could not even participate in the game jam as for whatever reasons windows kept crashing on me. I would like to return to this game at one point as I think the gameplay loop and mechanics are fun. I definitely have a lot of ideas for level design etc.
