> Puzzle game

Penguin and parrot was a puzzle game I've designed. The gameplay revolves around controlling the penguin.The parrot then moves in the opposite direction of wherever you move. So if the penguin moves up then the parrot moves down. This allowed for some interesting mechanics and puzzles however I had to cut the game short and I could not participate in the game jam as for whatever reasons windows kept crashing on me. I would like to return to this game at one point as I think the gameplay loop and mechanics are fun. I definitely have a lot of ideas for level design etc.
