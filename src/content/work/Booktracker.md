> Booktracker desktop application

This is a desktop application that I've built from scratch to help keep track of books I've read so far,
and showcase them in a elegant way with the book covers. I used the express framework and nodejs.I did not need the additional functionailty from react or vue as this is a simple web application. express framework was the best choice for the task. 
As for styling I used vanilla css no bootstrap or tailwind used.
I'm using the openbookAPI to search for books. The database I'm using is sqlite to keep it lightweight and clean
.I then bundled it all together with electron. This desktop application can work on mac and linux as a result of using electron.
