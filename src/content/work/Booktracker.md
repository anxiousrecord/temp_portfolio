> Booktracker desktop application

This is a desktop application that I've built from scratch to help keep track of books I've read so far,
and showcase them in a elegant way with the book covers. I used the express framework and nodejs.
I'm also using the openbookAPI to search for books as for database I'm using sqlite to keep it lightweight and clean
.I then bundled it all together with electron. This desktop application can work on mac and linux due to using electron.
