This bot was created within a week. I was able to use my skills in python and since i had knowledge of the selenium webdriver. I was able to quickly draft and improved the bot. I went through several testings and polishing. The first version took about 14 seconds for the bot to book a booking. now it takes about 4 seconds. On top of the improvements. I have also added error checkings and allow the bot to help me select different seats based on availabilty for instance if the seat i wanted S120 was taken it knew that was the case and will help me grab another seat I wanted like S130.
