> A game about building and getting out of a tetris level

Using Godot, this game was made for a mini jam, It was created with a team size of 3. The game was made in about 3 days and it was our first time developing in godot.It's a game about building your way out of the level to win by stacking tetris blocks that hones in onto the player. you also get random skills like wall dash and wall jump depending on chance. This was to adhere to the competition rules where you had to make a game mechanic that would mean that each time you played the game there was something unique or new. The theme for the gamejam was dream hence we felt the idea of a player being stuck in a tetris level and needed to build his way out sounds like a dream people might have especially competitive tetris players. This was inspired by tetris effect which was a medical phenomenon
